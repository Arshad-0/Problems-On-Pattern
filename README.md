# 🌟 Problems-On-Pattern

> 🎯 *"Practice makes patterns perfect!"* – Whether you're a beginner learning loops or a pro brushing up logic, this repo is your pattern playground.

## 👋 Welcome!

This is a fun and interactive collection of **Java pattern programs** – from simple stars and pyramids to complex alphabet-shaped patterns. It's designed to **strengthen your logic building** and **enhance your Java skills** one pattern at a time.

## 📦 What's Inside?

🔤 Programs from `A.java` to `Z.java` – each drawing a pattern based on the shape of its respective alphabet.
💡 Examples of patterns include:

```
A.java ➜ Prints the pattern that looks like the letter 'A'
B.java ➜ Pattern that forms 'B'
...
Z.java ➜ Guess what? Yes, a pattern for 'Z'!
```

💥 **Great for:**

* Students practicing for coding rounds
* Developers revising the basics
* Teachers looking for pattern problems for exercises
